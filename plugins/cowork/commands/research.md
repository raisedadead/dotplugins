# Research

Research a topic with fact-checking, source verification, and persistent storage.

## Usage

```
/cowork:research [topic or question]
```

## Workflow

1. Check the research database for existing notes on this topic
2. Scope the research: identify what needs to be found
3. Run parallel web searches for breadth
4. Cross-reference claims across 2+ sources
5. Save findings to the research database with metadata
6. Deliver concise summary with confidence levels and source links

All research persists in `WORKSPACE/research/research.db` and `WORKSPACE/research/notes/`.
